Recommended reading app for the Bereans at the Gate

## Built with React and Firebase

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

We also use the fantastic Firebase database for a server-less and flexible application.
